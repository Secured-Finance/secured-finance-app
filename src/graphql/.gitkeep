# This file keeps the src/graphql directory in git
# GraphQL query files (.graphql) should be placed in this directory
# 
# Example usage:
# 1. Create your .graphql files here (e.g., user-transactions.graphql)
# 2. Run `npm run codegen:graphql` to generate TypeScript hooks
# 3. Import and use the generated hooks in your components
#
# The example.graphql file shows a basic query structure.
