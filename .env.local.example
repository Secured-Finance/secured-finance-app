# Local Configuration Override Template
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill with your API keys
# Never commit .env.local to Git
#
# NOTE: NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are exposed to the browser (not secret!)
# They are "public API keys" with domain/referrer restrictions
#
# Public defaults are defined in .env (no need to override unless you want your own keys)

# ============ Optional API Keys ============
# These improve performance but are not required for development
# The app works without them using the defaults in .env

# RPC Providers (for better blockchain performance)
